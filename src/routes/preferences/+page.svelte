<p>
	Here are several preferences or settings you can change in order to customize
	the way this website looks and works. Click the icon (<img
		src={moreInfo}
		alt="moreinfo"
		style="width: 1em;"
	/>) on the right of each setting for more information on that setting.
</p>

<p>
	All the website settings are "sticky," and so when you change your
	preferences, the website will remember whatever settings you choose, even if
	you close your web browser and come back later.
